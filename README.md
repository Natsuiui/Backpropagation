# Backpropagation
Python code for Back propagation and Weight Updation.

### The Neural Network - 
<img width="992" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Natsuiui/Backpropagation/assets/95848110/8cdb24e8-7f9a-415d-a584-89e67c8139d9">

Here, Biases are frozen and only the weights are updated
Values of weights - 
[w1,w2,...,w8] = [0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55]

Values of Biases (FROZEN) -
b1 = 0.35
b2 = 0.6

Values of Inputs
x1 = 0.05
x2 = 1

True Values of Outputs y1 and y2
Out1 = 0.01
Out2 = 0.99

### Functions you will need -
#### Sigmoid Function (For Activation)
zout = 1/(1 + e-z)

#### MSE (Mean Squared Error for Loss)
error = 1/n * Σ(TrueY - PredictedY)²

##### Have fun using it and customizing it as much as you want! You can add an optimizer and unfreeze the biases to get way faster convergence! Play with it!
##### To know more about the calculation of Gradients, feel free to ask me @ kshitijsharma1106@gmail.com, ill be happy to send you the entire calculations :D
